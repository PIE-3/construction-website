        <div class="history" id="history">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">HISTORY</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                PC Construction’s success is due to its employees’ dedication to excellent work, customer service that 
                exceeds expectations, and a safety program that has led to millions of zero-accident hours. Honesty and 
                open communication have empowered PC Construction’s workforce since day one, and it shows in our work. <br>
                In 1958, Angelo G. Pizzagalli and two of his sons, Angelo and Remo, founded Pizzagalli Pre-Cast Stone to
                handle masonry construction and manufacture cut stone.  Since the beginning, the Pizzagalli family infused 
                its company with strong core values and set the standard for the "PC Way". <br>
                The company quickly expanded into residential and remodeling projects, necessitating a name change to 
                Pizzagalli Construction Company in 1960. Upon the death of Angelo G., the masonry operation was phased 
                out and focus shifted to commercial, industrial and institutional building projects. <br>
                The company grew by leaps and bounds over the next few years, attracting expert construction
                professionals with diverse backgrounds and formed a team that would become Vermont’s largest 
                construction company by 1964. As the company expanded, so did its reach — projects spread across the 
                United States and into the Caribbean. Since the mid-1980s, the company has been ranked among the top
                200 largest construction firms in the Nation by Engineering News-Record. <br>
                In 1998, Angelo, Jim, and Remo Pizzagalli began divesting their ownership in the company, a transition
                that led to 100% employee-ownership in 2009. Two years later, the company name was changed to PC
                Construction Company — a natural progression reflecting the shift from a small, family business started
                in 1958 to a thriving company now fully owned by the employees.
